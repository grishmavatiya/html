         <p>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.</p>

         <p>The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy <u>(as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal)</u>, political manipulation <u>(as with the 2016 U.S. elections)</u> and mass surveillance.Posts originating from the Facebook page of Breitbart News, a media organization previously affiliated with Cambridge Analytica,[10] are currently among the most widely shared political content on Facebook.Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content,as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.</p>
